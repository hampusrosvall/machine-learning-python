# Introduction 
Implemenatation of machine learning algorithms in Python as a part of the course 
Applied Machine Learning at the Faculty of Engineering, Lund University. 

# Description 
The repository contains implementation of the following algorithms: 

1) Decision tree 
2) Baysian classifiers (Naive Bayes, Gaussian Naive Bayes)
3) Expectation-Maximization Naive Bayes clustering algorithm
4) K-means and KNN 
5) Monte carlo control 

Moreover, the repository also consists of a POS-tagger using RNN as well as 
classification of flowers using CNN 

# Running the code 
Clone down repo and install dependencies. Run the files by running the following line in terminal: 

`python <name_of_folder>/<name_of_file.py>`
